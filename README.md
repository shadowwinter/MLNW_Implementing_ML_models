# MLNW_Implementing_ML_models
Implementing own machine learning algorithm codes without libraries.

For this coursework, we are to implement our own code and not use libraries (except where explicitly asked). 
We must present our own code that performs nested cross-validation and the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, build confusion matrices, and estimate distances between data samples.

The purpose of this coursework is to help:
-Get familiar with common python modules / functions used for ML in python
-Get practical experience implementing ML methods in python
-Get practical experience regarding parameter selection for ML methods
-Get practical experience on evaluating ML methods and applying cross-validation
